**********OPEN ADDRESSING************:

Idea of open addressing is to use a single array rather than using different data structures.

Basic requirrement : no. of slabs in hash table >= no. of keys to be inserts.

Cache friendly.

Multiple ways of implements: 
1)Linear probing.
2)Quadratic probing.
3)Double hashing.


******INSERTION********

Eg:
We use linear probing : linearly search for the next empty space when there is a collision.

{50,51,49,16,56,15,19}

hash=key%7.

    0   49  
    1   50
    2   51
    3   16
    4   56
    5   15
    6   19

If we are mapping to last slot and last slot is occupied we linearly search circularly.

{48,42,50,55,53}

    0   42
    1   50
    2   55
    3
    4   53
    5
    6   48

For 55 we search linearly in curcular manner for empty space.


********SEARCH*********

We compute hash function for the element we have to find. We go to that index and compare if we find the key we are done and we 
return true or the corresponding value. Otherwise we keep on search and we stop when 1)We find the key,2)We find an empty slot,
3)Traverse through  the whole table and are at the same index.


********DELETE********

Problem with simply making the slot empty: 

Eg:

insert(50).insert(51),insert(15),search(15),delete(51),search(15).
(hash=hey%7)
After insert 51:

0  
1  50
2  51
3  15
4
5
6

After delete 51:

0  
1  50
2  
3  15
4
5
6

So now if we search(15) we get a empty slot just before 15 and the search will stop there.

So to deal with this we mark that slot as Deleted sort and the search must not stop at deleted slot and insert can insert at deleted sort.


********CLUSTERING (PROBLEM WITH LINEAR PROBING)**********

Due to linear probing clusters are created. So when k consecutive positions are filled and a new hash to be inserted then the 
cluster will increase by size 1 and become k+1. So due to clustering every operation becomes costly.


*******TO HANDLE CLUSTERING***********

So this is what we were doing in linear probing : hash(key,i)=(h(key)+i)%m. Basically linear searching for empty slots.

To prevent this we can use:

****1)Quadratic probing****

hash(key,i)=(h(key)+i^2)%m.

This leads to less clustering and hence less costly for other operations. But the problem of clustering remains.
This leads to secondary clustering (linear had primary clusters).

Another disadvantage is that it might not find a empty slot even if there is one present.

So mathematically Quadratic probing will find a slot only if :

1)Alpha(load factor)<0.5 or number of slots present> number of keys.

2)m is prime.


****2)Double hashing****:
