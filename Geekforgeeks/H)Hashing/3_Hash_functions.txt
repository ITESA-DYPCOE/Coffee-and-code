Hash functions group large amount of keys into smaller groups.

Also hash functions should generate the same value for same input key.

How hash functions work:
1)Should always map a large key to same small key.
2)Should generate values from 0 to m-1
3)Should be fast , O(1) for integers and O(len) for strings of length of len
4)Should uniformly distribute large keys into hash table slot.

Some examples of hash functions:

1)Hash_func(large_keys)=large_keys%m (though this leads to lot of collision)
(typically this number m is chosen as a prime number close to the size of the hash table as less common 
factor and better distibution of large keys)
(bad decision is to use power of 2 or 10 or prime numbers close to them as they consider only some bits 
or some digits)
(so the above is simple/bad hash function )

2)For strings, weighting sum.
 str[]="abcd"
 sum=str[0]*x^0+str[1]*x^1...
(This hash function is better than taking just the sum of ASCII values)

3)Universal hashing : means to have a set of hash functions and to randomly pick one of them to hash 
a value.

IMP PTS:
Collision is bound to happen.

Size of hash table will be proportional to the numbers of elements we want to insert in it.
