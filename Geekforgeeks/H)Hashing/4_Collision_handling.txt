Collision: when two keys maps to the same hash value in the hash table.

Birthday paradox: if there 23 ppl in a room then there is 50% prob that two ppl have same birthday, with 70 ppl it is 99.9 percent.

If we know keys in advance, then we use perfect hashing.(advance methods)

If we do not know keys, then we use one of the following:
1)Chaning : we make a chain of colliding values.
2)Open addressing: if some position is occupied we try to put the value in next unoccupied position.
    *Linear probing
    *Quadractic probing
    *Double hashing.
