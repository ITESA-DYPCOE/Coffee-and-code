*******CHAINING********

The idea is to maintain an array of linked list. 

We use a hash function and using that we create a hash table which contains elements in linked list for
each value of hash.

Eg: For hash(key)=key%7 we make an array of size seven with each element of that array being a linked list header
    And we put element at position key%7.

    Hash table for the above linked list for following elements:

    {50,21,58,17,15,49,56,22,23,25}

    0    21->49->56
    1    50->15->22
    2    58->23
    3    17
    4    25
    5
    6

Also the hash function must have be choosen wisely.  

*******Performance of CHAINING******:

m= no. of slots in hash table.
n= no. of keys to be inserted

load factor alpha=n/m (this means how big we want our hash table to be)
(load factor leads to trade off of space for time)
(if load factor is small then we have less collision)

For expected chain length we assume uniform dist of keys = alpha (load factor).

So if we make a hash table of size n the alpha is 1 and hence hash function have O(1) or constant time 
requirrement.

Expected time to search = O(1+alpha)

Expected time to insert/delete = O(1+alpha)
(So for alpha=1 we have O(1) for both)

*******Data structures for storing chains**********:

1) Linked list : Search O(L),
                 delete O(L),
                 Insert O(L)

  (L being the length of a chain). 
  Disadv : *Not cache friendly (it is not storing nodes concurrently).
           *Uses extra space for storing next references and pointers.

2) Dynamic sized array (vectors in cpp, Arraylist in java): Same as above.
    
    But the advantage with them is cache friendliness.

3)Self balancing BST: (AVL tree,Red black tree)
                
                Search O(logL),
                delete O(logL),
                Insert O(logL).

    But self balancing BST are not cache friendly.
