OVERVIEW OF SORTING ALGORITHMS:

1) Binary array prob : can be solved using partition algo (lomuto and hoare's).

2)Array with three value: can also be solved by using DUTCH NATION FLAG ALGORITHM.

3)Array of size n and small ranged val : counting sort.

4)Array of size n and range is of size n^2 or n^3 or above : radix sort.

5)Array of uniformly distributed data over a range: Bucket sort.

6)Where memory writes are costly : cycle/selection sort.

7)When adjacent swapes are allowed : bubble sort(better version of bubble sort is cocktail sort).

8)When array size is small: insertion sort.

9)When available extra memory is less: Shell sort (it does not use extra memory and takes O(n(logn)^2) time).



GENERAL PURPOSE SORTING ALGORITHM:

For random data we need atleast nlogn time to sort.

Merge sort(nlogn) (works well for linked list or some special cases, also it stable) 
(its memory can be reduced to O(1) also works well for sequencial reads) (divide and conq hence be use for parallel sorting)
Heap sort (nlogn) 
Quick sort (nlogn in avg and n^2 in worst) (fastest)

HYBRID SORTING:

Tim sort(python , merge+insertion)

Introsort (cpp, quick+heap(when no calls >logn)+insertion(small arrays))

Stable sort (stable_sort in cpp, implemented using merge sort)
