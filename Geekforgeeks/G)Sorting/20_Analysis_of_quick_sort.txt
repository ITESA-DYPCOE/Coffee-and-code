Quick sort:

********Time complexity*********=

Worst case:O(n^2) (when array divided in two parts of 1 and n-1/when array is sorted)
Best case:O(nlogn) (when array divided in 2 equal parts)
Average case:O(nlogn)

*********Space complexity********

The partition function of quick sort is inplace.

Overall the inplace nature depends on the definition of inplace algo.
If we define inplace as taking auxillary space then quick sort is not inplace due to recursive call stack.

The other definition of inplace is the algorithm which do not copy the elements into temp array so then quick sort is inplace.


*********Space requirred for recursive call stack***********

Extra space requirred can be seen as height of the recursion tree.

Worst case : theta(n) (when array divided in two parts of 1 and n-1 parts it occupies call stack due to n recursive calls)
Best case: theta(logn+1) (when array is divided in two equal parts of n/2 and n/2).

This space is requirred only for quick sort not partition func's.

******Hoare's vs Lomuto's*******:

Hoare’s scheme is more efficient than Lomuto’s partition scheme because it does three times fewer swaps on average, and
it creates efficient partitions even when all values are equal.

Like Lomuto’s partition scheme, Hoare partitioning also causes Quick sort to degrade to O(n^2) when the input array is 
already sorted, it also doesn’t produce a stable sort.


Note that in this scheme, the pivot’s final location is not necessarily at the index that was returned, and the next two segments that 
the main algorithm recurs on are (lo..p) and (p+1..hi) as opposed to (lo..p-1) and (p+1..hi) as in Lomuto’s scheme.



******Randomized pivot********:
The quick sort algo (lomuto & hoare) will always give the worst time and space complexity with sorted array so it leads to pattern of worst cases.

To prevent this from happening we use random pivot from l to r and swap it with the pre-decided pivot of our algo. This prevents a pattern of worst cases 
and can be proved to have a time complexity of O(nlogn) and space complexity of O(logn).
